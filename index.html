<h3>Wearable Devices</h3>
<p>Recently, I attended a gathering on “wearable devices” in the city. The event room was covered with people from all walks of the IT industry – investors, CEOs, engineers, students and professors. All the people were there, looking forward to grasp a bit of new knowledge on the buzz of how these “smart” little devices would change our lives.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-we-have-now-">What do we have now ?</h4>

<p>Most devices we have now are “Sensor” centric, meaning that all the wearable devices that are available now on the market, are based on the following sensors – GPS, Altitude/Latitude, Accerometer, Light Sensor, Camera and Temperature. These sensors are believed to be able to extend our body functions, and will “understand” our situation in our environment better than us, by transmitting data live to some server via wifi or 3g network. But is it true ?</p>

<h4 id="the-middle-phase">The middle phase</h4>

<p>It is quite ironic, because we have all these sensors on our cellphones, and the question came as: why do we need additional sensors that is attached to our body constantly ? And will we emerge into a future, where these sensors are permanently attached to us ? I think the answer is positive, and what we have now is only the “middle phase”, where human beings eagerly looks for a suitable relationship with devices. Also, how we handle all the data collected, remains a curious issue.</p>

<h4 id="do-we-need-them-">Do we need them ?</h4>

<p>First of all, ask yourselves, what kind of experience is it that will please us in terms of “smart devices”. The answer shouldn’t be “wearable”. Devices and sensors that can really extend our body functions won’t join our carbon based body through wearing – simply attaching it to our bodies. What we need is an “embeded” experience not “wearable” experience, which is why many people aren’t buying wearable devices these days despite the full-coverage marketing campaign.</p>

<h4 id="well-known-problems">Well known problems</h4>

<p><strong>Battery</strong></p>

<p>Google Glass only have a maximum 3 hours of battery, which is far less than expected. Most smart watches only have a 1-2 days of battery, and the recharging time interfere with usability severely. Sensors like video cameras, and screens takes a large portion of battery life. On the other hand, devices that doesn’t have a screen maintains far better battery life than those that does.</p>

<p><strong>Usability</strong></p>

<p>Usability of Google Glass is quite inacceptable, despite the short battery life. It is also unfriendly to the short sighted. Smartwatches, on the other hand, are quite hard to use beacause of the low screen resolution, so that the screen isn’s so “touchable”.</p>

<h4 id="embeded-and-invisible-devices">Embeded and Invisible Devices</h4>

<p>In popular opinions, there should be three phases for smart devices: Wearable, Invisible and Embedded. The currend phase is only the beginning, and as glasses and watches are developed by more makers and corporations.</p>
